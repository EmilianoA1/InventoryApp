This is the first version of this software, so it have opportunities to been update.
I can't find SQLDriver for Java for that reason I don't add the driver at folder and
the software needs that driver to work well. Also it needs a JCalendar plugin, again
I can't find a version to Java, in case that you have those drivers only add and the
software works well.

The JCalendarFields is for the nomina's window, it have a part that need two dates.
